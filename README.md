# CMPM-163-HW2

HW2A: Uses a tron shader which consists of an outline shader, an x-ray shader, and a bloom filter. The scene is static, there are no moving objects. The body of the alligator can be seen through one of the standard objects.

HW2B: A mountainous height map inside of a skybox/cubemap (but not inside an actual cube). It uses snow, grass, and rock textures along with a noise texture to define the height map. The water is a combination of the toon water shader with the reflection code provided in class.

Link to HW2A: In "HW2A Build.zip"; Unity would not build HW2A in WebGL.

Credits: Google Poly was where I found the Alligator, Tent, and Forest meshes; simply look them up by name and compare polys
CatLikeCoding for the Bloom Code,  https://roystan.net/articles/toon-water.html was where I found the Toon Water Shader Tutorial
The Rock, Snow, and Grass Textures were from Google Images

The Reflection Shader was inspired from Lectures

# CMPM-163-HW2

HW2A: Uses a tron shader which consists of an outline shader, an x-ray shader, and a bloom filter. The scene is static, there are no moving objects. The body of the alligator can be seen through one of the standard objects.

HW2B: A height map inside of a skybox/cubemap (but not inside an actual cube). The water is a combination of the toon water shader with the reflection code provided in class.
